Hello Everyone, this week, we will start making some homeworks on our blockchain environment. 

The first homework will be as follows,

1) Use struct.sol contract for your beginning point. 
2) Create an static array for 25 students.
3) Allow people to join your students list.
4) Do not allow one address or name make double registration and return a message that says, "Already enrolled"
5) Create a view function to list "all" students already enrolled

Hints:
- You will need to modify struct and add address variable.
- You can use pure function to count successful enrollments.
